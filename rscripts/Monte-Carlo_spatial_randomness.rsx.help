S'ALG_DESC'
p1
VThis is a Monte Carlo test for the point patterns. It is based on simulations from the null hypothesis. It generates randomly dinstributed points within the study region and uses K-function for each set of generated points and compares them to the K-function for the original set of points. Detailed description can be found in correspondin section of this book: http://www.csiro.au/resources/pf16h.\u000a\u000aThis script will provide both graphical ('R plots') and verbose ('R console output') output.

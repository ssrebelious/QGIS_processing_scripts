VThis R script computes simulation envelopes of the G(r) - nearest neighbour distance distribution function.\u000a\u000aThe nearest neighbour distance distribution function (also called the "event-to-event" or "inter-event" distribution) of a point process X is the cumulative distribution function G of the distance from a typical random point of X to the nearest other point of X. An estimate of G derived from a spatial point pattern dataset can be used in exploratory data analysis and formal inference about the pattern. In exploratory analyses, the estimate of G is a useful statistic summarising one aspect of the \u201cclustering\u201d of points. For inferential purposes, the estimate of G is usually compared to the true value of G for a completely random (Poisson) point process, which is where lambda is the intensity (expected number of points per unit area). Deviations between the empirical and theoretical G curves may suggest spatial clustering or spatial regularity.\u000a\u000aFor more information please refer to:\u000a\u000ahttp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/spatstat.pdf
